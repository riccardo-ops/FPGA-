**Main Goal**

Aim of this Project is to use the Seven Segment Display to print two digits : seconds and 1/10th of seconds.
A Reset button (active low) resets the value of the digits, as long as it's pressed. Otherwise, the logic is free-running.
When 9.9 seconds is reached, it resets back to 0.0.


**Hardware**

For this project, an Altera Dev Board clone is used (https://github.com/forem1/FPGA). It's a very cheap alternative (approx. 40 â‚¬) to the very expensive ones, but the FPGA is a dated Cyclone IV, with not so many logic cells. 
It's perfect for hobby-related projects, but not for more intensive operations.
I suggest to follow this series of projects and contatct me if anything is wrong or not clear.
