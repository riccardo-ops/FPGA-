# Main Goal

**Aim of this Project:**  
Use the Seven Segment Display to print two digits: seconds and 1/10th of seconds.

## Hardware

For this project, an Altera Dev Board clone is used ([link](https://github.com/forem1/FPGA)).  
It's a very cheap alternative **OMDAZZ dev board** (approx. 40 â‚¬)
A **Reset button** (active low) resets the value of the digits, as long as it's pressed. Otherwise, the logic is *free-running*.  
When **9.9 seconds** is reached, it resets back to **0.0**.


> It's perfect for hobby-related projects, but not for more intensive operations.

I suggest to follow this series of projects and **contact me** if anything is wrong or not clear.
